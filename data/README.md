# Sample Data and Runtime Evidence

This folder contains sample runtime data and photos captured from the Smart Coffee Box during operation.  
These files demonstrate real sensor readings and system behaviour.

## Included Files

### 1. Sensor Log (simulated runtime)
- `sensor_log_2026-01-05.txt`  
  Continuous readings collected every 5 minutes over a 3-hour period.
  Includes:
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Humidity (%RH)
  - TVOC (ppb)

This file provides evidence of long-term stability and measurement trends.

### 2. OLED Display Photos
- `oled_freshly_stored.jpg`  
  Display reading shortly after placing fresh coffee beans in the enclosure.
- `oled_after_storage_period.jpg`  
  Display reading after beans have remained in storage for a period of time.

These images illustrate how temperature, humidity and TVOC levels vary over time while the system is running.

More logged data, charts or additional photos may be added as testing continues.
